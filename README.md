Phone Numbers Kata
=================

Problem statement.
You will be receiving telephone numbers input by ordinary users, as e.g. entered through a web form.  A valid phone number, as we need to define it here, must start with a '9', and be followed by exactly 10 digits.  Assume that users may use spaces, hyphens, parentheses or commas when typing the number in.  These are irrelevant characters which are to be discarded.  Thus given e.g. "9 (608) 555-1212" as input, the function you are to define must return "96085551212".  For this first implementation of a solution, for a number which does not meet the conditions of validity, "invalid" is to be returned.

Within this repository I have put some of my answers for this kata and will eventually attempt to complete it in various languages.
